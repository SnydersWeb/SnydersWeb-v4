</div>

I've almost always been a computer programmer.  I started in the summer of my third grade year with a "Kids and the Apple" class that taught me the very basics and from that point on I was off and running.  My forth grade teacher, Ron Stone, learned how to program by watching me.  I can still vividly recall him telling my parents "You have <strong>got</strong> to get this kid a computer!"  My mom and dad scrimped and saved - eventually purchasing our Franklin Ace 1200, essentially an Apple II Plus knockoff, where I spent countless hours playing, programming, and learning.<br /><br />

After graduating from <a href="http://www.hhsc.k12.in.us/">Hamilton Heights</a>, I attended <a href="http://www.purdue.edu">Purdue University</a> in the department of <a href="http://www.tech.purdue.edu/cg/">Technical Graphics</a> (now called Computer Graphics).  During my student years my computer skills stood out a bit amongst my peers and department faculty would sometimes ask for my assistance in troubleshooting their computer issues.  I took the very first HTML course the university offered and build some of my first web pages.  The Web was the perfect place for me to I was able to combine my computer expertise, enjoyment of programming, and degree in graphics into a career that I have a love and passion for.<br /><br />

My professional career has lead me to a few places, first staring for a company named Datastream Systems, Inc. based out of Greenville, SC in 1996 where I worked for 5 years as the company webmaster.  While there I garnered several awards for my work and learned a number of skills I use to this day.<br /><br />

After Datastream I moved to Colorado in 2002 where I took my next job in Gypsum, CO as webmaster for a company called WestStar Bank.  While there I lived in the city of Glenwood Springs - famous for natural Hot Springs and the Glenwood Adventure park.  During that time I volunteered my time and talents for the Glenwood Springs Center for the Arts designing their site <a href="../webSites/freelance/index.html">seen here</a> and designing posters for their main fundraising event - the Wine and Brewfest.<br /><br />

WestStar Bank was eventually acquired by U.S. Bank and I went to work for a company called Wall Street On Demand based out of Boulder, CO in 2007 and moved to Thornton where I reside today.<br /><br />

Working at Wall Street on Demand was an amazing experience.  I knew when I was offered the job I would be taking a tiger by the tail, that it would be intense, intimidating, exciting and that I would be walking amongst giants there.  I learned so much about the craft of web development - growing from a very competent developer to mastery of a great plethora of different technologies.<br /><br />

In 2009 I met and married my wonderful wife, Molly.  Five years later, we were joined by our son.  Being a husband and father has been one of those few things I've enjoyed more than being a developer.<br /><br />

After seventeen years and numerous acquisitions, I have parted ways with Wall Street On Demand/Markit/IHS Markit/S&amp;P Global and am currently seeking the next chapter of my career.<br /><br />
